# Workflow for serving app locally & running Meticulous tests against it

name: Meticulous

# Important: The workflow needs to run both on pushes to your main branch and on
# pull requests. It needs to run on your main branch because it'll use the results
# from the base commit of the PR on the main branch to compare against.

  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Important: We need the workflow to be triggered on workflow_dispatch events,
  # so that Meticulous can run the workflow on the base commit to compare
  # against if an existing workflow hasn't run
  workflow_dispatch: {}

# Important: The workflow needs all the permissions below.
# These permissions are mainly need to post and update the status check and
# feedback comment on your PR. Meticulous wonâ€™t work without them.

        # Notes:
        #
        # 1. Please make sure your serve command listens 0.0.0.0 rather than
        #    localhost or 127.0.0.1 (i.e. listens to all requests via all network
        #    interfaces rather than just the loopback interface - see
        #    https://stackoverflow.com/a/20778887 for more details)
        # 2. The sleep is often required to ensure your app is readily being served
        #    by the time the Meticulous tests start
